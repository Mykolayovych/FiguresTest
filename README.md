Figures

The goal of this assignment is to write a simple HTML / JavaScript program that interacts with the user and builds geometric shapes on the screen. The output of the program should be a file, "index.html", which can be run in any browser with the latest version of the update.

Task condition

The user selects three arbitrary points in the client area of ​​the browser. When they are selected, the program highlights their location by drawing red circles for each selected point. The diameter of the circle should be 11 pixels.

Based on these three points, you need to build two figures:
a blue parallelogram, with three vertices at selected points
yellow circle, with the same area and center of mass as the parallelogram.

These figures should not be filled.
The coordinates of the selected points, as well as the area of ​​the parallelogram and circle should be presented to the user numerically.

The user should be free to move the points in the screen area at any time. Moving the points changes the image of the parallelogram and the circle accordingly and displays the updated figures.

There should also be a "reset" function that clears the area and allows the user to select three new points and repeat the entire process described above.

You need to implement an "about" feature that records your own information about the program, its author, and instructions for using it.
